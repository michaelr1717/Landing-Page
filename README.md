# Landing-Page

The point of this landing page was to get better working with the HTML Flexbox dispay and getting more creative with my CSS. The content doesn't mean much and was just used as a placeholder so I could better see the effects of CSS on the webpage. I hope to revisit this when I have some free time and make it into a personal webpage.
